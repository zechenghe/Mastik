-----------------------------------
The code is from and modified to run on Linux:
https://github.com/msmania/microarchitectural-attack

The code domostrate Spectre v1 and v2 attacks.
-----------------------------------
02_specre_toy:
A toy example training the BTB within process.

To run:
$ make
$ ./spectre --variant2

-----------------------------------
04_spectre_full:

1. compile and load the code in "gadget" folder. Use the README inside.
It is a shared library for flush+reload cache covert channel across processes. 

2. use the code in "attack_clean" folder

$ make
open two terminals:
Term1: $ ./spectre --victim
Term2: $ ./spectre --train --probe
The victim code is thus running in parallel with the attacker code.
The attacker code has two threads: on thread colocate with the victim to train the BTB, the other thread reload+flush the data array.


The code can also be run as follows:
Term1: $ ./spectre --victiom --probe
Term2: $ ./spectre --train
In this case, the victim code flush+reload and retrives secret. The training thread trains the BTB.
